<h2> Problem </h2>
Financial statements are windows that provide an overview of a company's financial health. However, for many people, this report often feels like a puzzle that is difficult to solve. Technical terms, complicated numbers, and dense structures make financial statements difficult for those who do not have financial backgrounds.<br></br>

**The root of the problem** lies in a significant information gap between companies that issue financial statements and the general public, especially prospective insurance customers. Financial statements, which should be an important source of information for financial decision making, actually become a barrier for several reasons:

**Language complexity:** financial statements are prepared using accounting standards and technical terms that may not be familiar to ordinary people. Terms such as "current assets," "" net profit, "or" debt to equity ratio "can be confusing and make people reluctant to read the report as a whole.

**Solid structure:** Financial statements usually consist of many pages containing tables, numbers, and footnotes. This solid structure makes it difficult for people to find relevant information and understand how these numbers are interrelated.

**Lack of context:** Financial statements often only present numbers without providing sufficient context. For example, high sales figures may look positive, but without comparing them with previous years or with competitors, it is difficult to assess whether the company's performance is really good.

**Limited time and resources:** Many people do not have time or resources to study accounting or hire financial experts to analyze financial statements. They need a fast and easy way to get relevant information.

<h2>Impact of Problem:</h2>

This information gap has several negative impacts:

**Inappropriate financial decisions:** Prospective insurance customers may find it difficult to assess the financial health of insurance companies and choose products that suit their needs.
**Low financial literacy:** Lack of understanding of financial statements can hamper efforts to increase public financial literacy.
**Unbelief in the financial industry:** the complexity of financial statements can create the impression that the financial industry is not transparent and can only be understood by a handful of people.

<h2>The impact of buying insurance without understanding the company's financial statements</h2>

**Buying an insurance policy without understanding the financial condition of the insurance company can cause some detrimental risks:**

**Wrong Choosing Insurance Companies:** Without understanding financial statements, someone might choose an insurance company that is experiencing financial difficulties. This can have an impact on the company's ability to pay future claims or even lead to company bankruptcy.

**More expensive premiums:** insurance companies that are experiencing financial difficulties may wear more expensive premiums to cover their losses. By understanding financial statements, prospective customers can compare premiums and choose more stable companies and offer more competitive premiums.

**The protracted claim process:** Financial insurance companies may have difficulty processing claims quickly. This can cause late payment of claims, even for months or years.

**Loss of money:** In the worst scenario, if the insurance company goes bankrupt, the customer may lose the money they have paid as a premium. This is certainly very detrimental and can cause financial difficulties for customers.

<h2>The Importance of Understanding Financial Statements</h2>

By understanding the financial statements of the insurance company, prospective customers can make more intelligent and informed decisions. They can assess the company's financial health, compare insurance products offered, and choose companies that best suit their needs and risk profiles. This will help them avoid unnecessary financial risk and get optimal insurance protection.
