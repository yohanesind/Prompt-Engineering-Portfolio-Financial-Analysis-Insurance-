<h1>Gemini AI is a large language model (LLM) developed by Google</h1> 
His ability to understand and produce texts in human language makes it a very useful tool for decomposing the complexity of financial statements. Here is the way to Gemini AI acts as a solution:
<br></br>

**Understanding of Financial Statements:** Gemini AI is trained in very large financial statement data, so he has a deep understanding of accounting terms, financial metrics, and financial statement structures. This allows him to "read" and "digest" information from financial statements in a way similar to a financial analyst.

**Extraction of Key Information:** By using the right prompt, Gemini AI can be directed to extract specific information from financial statements. For example, we can ask AI to find out how much the company's net profit, what is the ratio of debt to equity, or sales trends over the past few years.

**Simplification of Language:** Gemini AI is able to present complex financial information in a simpler and easier to understand language. This is very helpful for ordinary people who may not be familiar with technical terms in financial statements.

**Analysis and Interpretation:** In addition to extracting information, Gemini AI can also provide analysis and interpretation of financial data. For example, AI can explain what the meaning of certain financial ratios, identifying positive or negative trends, or even providing recommendations based on existing data.

 <h1>Chain-of-Thought (Cot) Prompting</h1>

**Chain-of-Thought (COT)** Prompting is a new relatively new technique in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and especially in interaction with large language models (Large Language Models/LLM) such as Gemini AI.

Cot Prompting involves giving instructions to the AI ​​model to not only give the final answer, but also to explain the steps of reasoning or thought that leads to the answer. In other words, Cot pushed the AI ​​model to "think hard" and show the process of thinking, similar to how humans solve problems.

<h3>How does Cot Prompting work?</h3>

**Early Prompt:** The user gives an initial prompt that asks the AI ​​model to complete an assignment or answer questions.<br></br>
**Thought Steps-Demi-Steps:** AI Model does not immediately give the final answer, but rather breaks the task into several smaller steps and explains each detailed step.<br></br>
**Final Answer:** After completing all the steps of thought, the AI ​​model gives the final answer based on the reasoning that has been explained<br></br>

<h1>Why Cot Prompting Effective?</h1>

**Cot Prompting has several advantages over traditional promptations:**

**Increasing accuracy:** By forcing AI models to explain its reasoning, Cot can help reduce errors and increase the accuracy of answers.<br></br>
**Increasing transparency:** Cot provides insight into how the AI ​​model comes to conclusions, so that users can better understand and trust the results.<br></br>
**Facilitating learning:** Cot can help AI learning models from their own mistakes and improve their performance from time to time.<br></br>
In the context of financial statement analysis, Cot Prompting allows Gemini AI to provide a more in -depth and transparent analysis. This helps users understand not only the results of the analysis, but also the thought process behind it, so they can make a more appropriate and informed decision.

<h1>How It Works</h1>

**Prompt Design:** I meticulously crafted prompts that guide Gemini AI to identify and extract the most relevant information from financial statements. These prompts are tailored to answer specific questions that potential policyholders might have, such as:

**With AI, financial statements are no longer just a collection of confusing numbers. You can ask directly about the information you need**

<h2>Talk with AI</h2>
With AI, you not only get a summary or analysis of rigid financial statements. You can interact directly with AI, ask specific questions, and get detailed explanations as if you are consulting with a financial expert.

This interaction takes place naturally and dynamically, like a conversation between two people. You can ask further questions, ask for clarification, or even ask AI to provide recommendations based on the analysis that has been done.

In this way, AI not only presents information, but also helps you understand and interpret financial data better. You no longer need to feel confused or overwhelmed when dealing with complex financial statements. AI is ready to be your discussion partner in exploring the financial world.

<h2>Results</h2>
The result is a powerful tool that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about insurance policies. By demystifying financial statements, this project promotes financial literacy and transparency, ultimately benefiting both consumers and the insurance industry.
